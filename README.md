[Jade](https://jade.wtf) uses code to solve specific problems and has no attachment to any particular language or methodology.

Any software available here under is provided [in some approximation of a gift](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20211229). As I've benefitted from others, I hope others may benefit from my work, but note that this does not imply any obligation to make it work for you.
